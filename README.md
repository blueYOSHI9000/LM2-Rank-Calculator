# Luigi's Mansion 2: Dark Moon - Rank Calculator
Does what it says, calculates your rank for a mission but more specifically, it shows the exact score so you *know* how close or far away you were.  
No, I don't expect this to really be useful, I just felt like making it so here you go. Enjoy. Or else.

## Todo:
- multiple languages?
- make sure the sw replaced outdated versions (done manually rn - also not exactly needed when the site is done)
